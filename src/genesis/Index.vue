        26
        <blockquote>Then God said, “Let us make manh in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”</blockquote>
        27
        <blockquote>So God created man in his own image,
          in the image of God he created him;
          male and female he created them.</blockquote>
          28
          <blockquote>And God blessed them. And God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”</blockquote>

        "Thou makest him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands; Thou has put all things under his feet: all sheep, and oxen, and also the beasts of the field; the birds of the sky, and the fish of the sea; whatever passes throught he paths of the seas. " <b>Psalm 8:7-9</b>

      <h1 class="title">You must rule over sin</h1>
      <blockquote>
        7 If you do well, will you not be accepted?b And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door. Its desire is contrary toc you, but <b>you must rule over it.</b>”
      </blockquote>
      <p>False teachers will tell you to give up. That sin is more powerful than you. Sin is powerful, but you are more powerful. You have the authority to rule over sin. <b>sin is lawlessness.</b></p>
      <p>Think of ruling over sin like ruling over the animals. Some animals are small - like bugs and cats. You are not afraid of a kitty cat and you know you are more powerful than it. There are other cats, like lions. Those are not cats you want to fight, you must run from a lion - even though you rule over lions. Sin is the same - do not think of sin as something that can beat you. But do not think sin is something you can be casual with either.</p>
