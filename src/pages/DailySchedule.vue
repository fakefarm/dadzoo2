        Daily Schedule

      <p>
        The body and mind do well when they are in a routine. Why? Because they can start doing things without thinking about them because they become habits. Then, your mind is freed up to think about more important things while you brush your teeth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though every day is different, most of the time our day to day lives are the same. It is best to become aware of your routines and work with them.
      </p>
      <h2 class="subtitle">
         No matter what your personality, it is best to learn the cycles. There are 24 hours in a day. How do you think about them? All of us live within 24 hour cycles. We do not control time. We do not control the sun or society.
